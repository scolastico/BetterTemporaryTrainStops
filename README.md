## Description
BetterTemporaryTrainStops is a factorio mod. The aim of this mod is a) to change the waiting conditions of temporary stops in trains and b) to provide you with the function of ordering your personal train to the nearest platform. The mod is also focused on being multiplayer friendly.

This mod was inspired by the [QoL-TempStations](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/QoL-TempStations) mod which unfortunately has not been updated and does not work in multiplayer.

## Language and Translations
This mod was translated into English and German. If you want to add your language, please open a pull request (with the translation of `locale.cfg`) and I will add it in the next update.

## Usage
First of all, after installing the mod, you should set up a train as a personal train. To do this, simply take a train of your choice (preferably a separate train so that you don't disturb your logistics network) and press the "Call your personal train" shortcut button. (If you can't see the shortcut button, you have to activate it in the menu first.)

If you have done everything correctly, there is also a notification in the chat that everything has worked.

Now you can, if you want, set the departure conditions for temporary stations. To do this, get back into your personal train and set all the conditions you want in the **currently selected** next stop.

When you are done press the "Call your personal train" shortcut button again. You should then receive another message that everything worked.

If you now make a temporary stop with your train in the future, these holding conditions will be set automatically. Please note that for reasons of performance and compatibility, the holding conditions are only changed shortly before arrival.

To call a train, just stand near a rail (the search radius can be changed in the settings) and press the "Call your personal train" shortcut button. You should receive a message to which rail exactly the train will be sent if everything has worked.

And as a little appendix: The whole thing also works with trains that are in manual mode (these are then set to automatic mode) and also with normal freight trains with other stops (the temporary stop is then set with the highest priority).
