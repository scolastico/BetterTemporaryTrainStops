## Description
BetterTemporaryTrainStops is a factorio mod. The aim of this mod is a) to change the waiting conditions of temporary stops in trains and b) to provide you with the function of ordering your personal train to the nearest platform. The mod is also focused on being multiplayer friendly.

This mod was inspired by the [QoL-TempStations](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/QoL-TempStations) mod which unfortunately has not been updated and does not work in multiplayer.
