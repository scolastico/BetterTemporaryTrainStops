[mod-setting-description]
btts-every-x-ticks=Check every X ticks for trains which are stopping at a train station. If the value is to high the mod doesnt work properly. If set to low lags are possible. Default is 30.
btts-enabled=Enable the mod for you. If you are not alone in a train with a temporary stop it will be enabled if at least one player in the train has the mod enabled. Default is enabled.
btts-timout-ticks=Set how many ticks need to pass until the train settings wont be changed by the first button click. This helps you to prevent accidentally settings loss for the hold conditions of a train if you want to change your personal train and try to assign the same train again to you. Default is 3600 (1 minute).
btts-enabled-only-in-personal-train=Change the hold conditions only if a player is in the train which has set the train to his personal train. Recommended to enable for better stability with other mods. Default is disabled.
btts-search-radius=The search radius for rails if a train is called. Should not set to high to improve performance. Default is 50.
